SLR, as the name implies, is a systematic way of collecting, critically evaluating, integrating, and presenting findings from across multiple research studies on a research question or topic of interest. SLR provides a way to assess the quality level and magnitude of existing evidence on a question or topic of interest. It offers a broader and more accurate level of understanding than a traditional literature review. A systematic review adheres to standardized methodologies/guidelines in systematic searching, filtering, reviewing, critiquing, interpreting, synthesizing, and reporting of findings from multiple publications on a topic/domain of interest. The Cochrane Collaboration is the most well-known and widely respected global organization producing SLRs within the healthcare field and a standard to follow for any researcher seeking to write a transparent and methodologically sound SLR. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), like the Cochrane Collaboration, was created by an international network of health-based collaborators and provides the framework for SLR to ensure methodological rigor and quality. The PRISMA statement is an evidence-based guide consisting of a checklist and flowchart intended to be used as tools for authors seeking to write SLR and meta-analyses. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","evidence based design; healthcare design; systematic literature review","evidence based medicine; human; literature; methodology; organization and management; software; writing; Authorship; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Research Design; Review Literature as Topic; Software",,,,,,,"Balshem, H., Helfand, M., Schunemann, H., Oxman, A., Kunz, R., Brozek, J., GRADE guidelines: 3.

The concept of EBM as a part of clinical decision making has become increasingly popular over the last decade. In the hierarchy of studies meta-analysis and systematic reviews occupy the highest levels. A systematic review of a clinical question can be performed by following a relatively standard form. These techniques as described here can be performed without formal training. Systematic reviews conducted in this fashion can be used as a higher form of current concepts or as review articles and replace the traditional expert opinion narrative review. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",,"conference paper; data analysis; data extraction; information retrieval; medical decision making; methodology; priority journal; quality control; systematic review; article; bibliographic database; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; evidence based medicine; human; literature; peer review; publishing; randomized controlled trial; writing; Databases, Bibliographic; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Peer Review, Research; Publication Bias; Randomized Controlled Trials; Review Literature; Writing",,,,,,,"Altman, D.G., Schulz, K.F., Moher, D., Egger, M., Davidoff, F., Elbourne, D., Gotzsche, P.C., Lang, T., The revised CONSORT statement for reporting randomized trials: Explanation and elaboration (2001) Ann Intern Med, 134, pp. 663-694; Antman, E.M., Lau, J., Kupelnick, B., Mosteller, F., Chalmers, T.C., A comparison of results of meta-analyses of randomized control trials and recommendations of clinical experts: Treatments for myocardial infarction (1992) JAMA, 268, pp. 240-248; Atkins, D., Best, D., Briss, P.A., Eccles, M., Falck-Ytter, Y., Flottorp, S., Guyatt, G.H., Zaza, S., Grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations (2004) BMJ, 328, p. 1490; Cook, D.J., Sackett, D.L., Spitzer, W.O., Methodologic guidelines for systematic reviews of randomized control trials in health care from the Potsdam Consultation on Meta-Analysis (1995) J Clin Epidemiol, 48, pp. 167-171; Dickersin, K., Scherer, R., Lefebvre, C., Identifying relevant studies for systematic reviews (1994) BMJ, 309, pp. 1286-1291; Easterbrook, P.J., Berlin, J.A., Gopalan, R., Matthews, D.R., Publication bias in clinical research (1991) Lancet, 337, pp. 867-872; Egger M, Davey Smith G, Schneider M, Minder C.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are also proliferating in the medical literature.Purpose: To provide the outline necessary for a practitioner to properly understand and/or conduct a systematic review for publication in a sports medicine journal.Study Design: Review.Methods: The steps of a successful systematic review include the following: identification of an unanswered answerable question; explicit definitions of the investigations participant(s), intervention(s), comparison(s), and outcome(s); utilization of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines and PROSPERO registration; thorough systematic data extraction; and appropriate grading of the evidence and strength of the recommendations.Results: An outline to understand and conduct a systematic review is provided, and the difference between meta-analyses and systematic reviews is described. The steps necessary to perform a systematic review are fully explained, including the study purpose, search methodology, data extraction, reporting of results, identification of bias, and reporting of the studys main findings.Conclusion: Systematic reviews or meta-analyses critically appraise and formally synthesize the best existing evidence to provide a statement of conclusion that answers specific clinical questions. Readers and reviewers, however, must recognize that the quality and strength of recommendations in a review are only as strong as the quality of studies that it analyzes. Thus, great care must be used in the interpretation of bias and extrapolation of the reviews findings to translation to clinical practice. Without advanced education on the topic, the reader may follow the steps discussed herein to perform a systematic review. © 2013 The Author(s) ©2013 The Author(s).","evidence-based medicine; meta-analysis; PRISMA; PROSPERO; systematic review","evidence based medicine; human; literature; medical literature; meta analysis (topic); orthopedics; publishing; sports medicine; standards; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Medical Writing; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Orthopedics; Publishing; Review Literature as Topic; Sports Medicine",,,,,,,"Bhandari, M., Morrow, F., Kulkarni, A.V., Tornetta, P., Meta-analyses in orthopaedic surgery: A systematic review of their methodologies (2001) J Bone Joint Surg Am, 83 (1), pp. 15-24; Booth, A., Clarke, M., Dooley, G., The nuts and bolts of PROSPERO: An international prospective register of systematic reviews (2012) Syst Rev, 1 (1), p. 2; Chandler, J., Churchill, R., Higgins, J., Lasserson, T., Tovey, D., Methodological Standards for the Conduct of New Cochrane Intervention Reviews, , http://www.editorial-unit.cochrane.org/sites/editorial-unit.cochrane.org/files/uploads/MECIR_conduct_standards%202.2%2017122012.pdf, Version 2.2.

A model is presented here for writing systematic reviews of argument-based literature: literature that uses arguments to address conceptual questions, such as whether abortion is morally permissible or whether research participants should be legally entitled to compensation for sustaining researchrelated injury. Such reviews aim to improve ethically relevant decisions in healthcare, research or policy. They are better tools than informal reviews or samples of literature with respect to the identification of the reasons relevant to a conceptual question, and they enable the setting of agendas for conceptual and empirical research necessary for sound policy-making. This model comprises prescriptions for writing the systematic review's review question and eligibility criteria, the identification of the relevant literature, the type of data to extract on reasons and publications, and the derivation and presentation of results. This paper explains how to adapt the model to the review question, literature reviewed and intended readers, who may be decision-makers or academics. Obstacles to the model's application are described and addressed, and limitations of the model are identified.",,"decision making; human; literature; management; methodology; organization and management; research; review; standard; writing; Decision Making; Humans; Policy Making; Research; Research Design; Review Literature as Topic; Writing",,,,,,,"Eden, J., Levit, L., Berg, A., (2011) Finding What Works in Health Care: Standards for Systematic Reviews, , Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee on Standards for Systematic Reviews of Comparative Effectiveness Research.

Our aim was to describe the process, facilitators, and barriers to completing the first 2-week full SR. Study Design and Setting: We systematically reviewed evidence of the impact of increased fluid intake, on urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrence, in individuals at risk for UTIs. The review was conducted by experienced systematic reviewers with complementary skills (two researcher clinicians, an information specialist, and an epidemiologist), using Systematic Review Automation tools, and blocked off time for the duration of the project. The outcomes were time to complete the SR, time to complete individual SR tasks, facilitators and barriers to progress, and peer reviewer feedback on the SR manuscript. Times to completion were analyzed quantitatively (minutes and calendar days); facilitators and barriers were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework; and peer reviewer feedback was analyzed quantitatively and narratively. Results: The SR was completed in 61 person-hours (9 workdays; 12 calendar days); accepted version of the manuscript required 71 person-hours. Individual SR tasks ranged from 16 person-minutes (deduplication of search results) to 461 person-minutes (data extraction). The least time-consuming SR tasks were obtaining full-texts, searches, citation analysis, data synthesis, and deduplication. The most time-consuming tasks were data extraction, write-up, abstract screening, full-text screening, and risk of bias. Facilitators and barriers mapped onto the following domains: knowledge; skills; memory, attention, and decision process; environmental context and resources; and technology and infrastructure. Two sets of peer reviewer feedback were received on the manuscript: the first included 34 comments requesting changes, 17 changes were made, requiring 173 person-minutes; the second requested 13 changes, and eight were made, requiring 121 person-minutes. Conclusion: A small and experienced systematic reviewer team using Systematic Review Automation tools who have protected time to focus solely on the SR can complete a moderately sized SR in 2 weeks. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","2 week systematic review; 2wSR; Automation; Barriers; Facilitators; Methods improvement; Systematic review accelerator; Systematic reviews","Article; automation; case study; citation analysis; clinician; data extraction; decision making; epidemiologist; fluid intake; human; infection risk; informatician; knowledge; memory; priority journal; publication; recurrent disease; screening; skill; systematic review; urinary tract infection",,,,,"National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC","Funding: The systematic review described in the manuscript was conducted as part of the work of the Centre of Research Excellence in Minimising Antibiotic Resistance in the Community (CRE-MARC), funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Australia.
